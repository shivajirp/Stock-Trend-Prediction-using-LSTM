**Stock Trend Prediction Project**

**-Overview:**
  This repository contains my Stock Trend Prediction project, which is designed to predict the future trends of stock prices using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. The key files in this repository are:

1. trained_model.h5: This file contains a trained LSTM model that's ready to predict stock trends based on historical data.
2. app.py: I've built a Streamlit web app that lets you interact with the predictions. Just enter a stock ticker and a date range, and watch the magic happen.
3. model.ipynb: Curious about the nitty-gritty details? Check out my Jupyter Notebook, where I trained the LSTM model using historical stock data.

**-Why LSTM?**
  LSTM, which stands for Long Short-Term Memory, is a powerful type of neural network designed to work with sequences. In our case, we're dealing with time series data, so LSTM's ability to capture temporal patterns and dependencies makes it the perfect candidate.

**-Prerequisites**
  You'll need a few Python libraries to run this project,
1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. tensorflow
4. yfinance
5. pandas
6. scikit-learn
7. keras
8. streamlit

**-Launch the Streamlit app:**
streamlit run app.py


**-Exploring the Streamlit App**
I've designed a user-friendly Streamlit app that lets you visualize historical stock data and predictions. Just enter the stock ticker and a date range, and the app will show you various charts, including closing price vs. time, moving averages, and predictions vs. original data.

**-Results**
My trained LSTM model achieved an impressive R2 score of around 0.97. It's a score that measures how well the model's predictions match the actual data. An R2 score of 0.97 indicates that the model is doing a great job.

**-Future Plans**
This project is a work in progress, and I'm continuously working on improving it and fixing any bugs that might pop up. I'm open to contributions, suggestions, and feedback, so feel free to jump in and help make this project even better!

If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.
